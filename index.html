						<h2>What Our Students Say About Tutoring4U</h2>
						<p>At Tutoring4U, we take pride in the success of our students. Here’s what they have to say about their experience:</p>
						<section>
							<div class="content">
								<div class="inner">
									<h2>Thomas Bird</h2>
									<p>At the start of Year 11, I was on track for a grade 4 or 5 in my Maths GCSE, and I was really struggling to feel confident in the subject. Federico completely changed that. His explanations were so clear, and for the first time, I actually started enjoying maths.<br><br>
										He didn’t just teach me the topics I learned how to approach exam questions, use the right techniques, and manage my time effectively. The weekly session reports helped me and my parents track my progress, so we always knew what I needed to focus on.<br><br>
										Thanks to Federico’s help, I achieved a grade 7 in my Maths GCSE something I never thought was possible! I couldn’t be happier, and I highly recommend him to anyone looking to improve their maths skills.</p>
								</div>

									<h2>Alessia Diadori</h2>
									<p>Before finding Federico, my son was really struggling with maths. His school had predicted that he would fail his GCSE, and after trying multiple tutors with no real improvement, he had lost confidence and interest in the subject.<br><br>
										Federico was our last hope, and I’m so glad we found him. From the very first session, my son felt more engaged he finally had a tutor who explained things in a way that made sense to him. Over time, we saw a real transformation. He started to grasp concepts he had previously struggled with, and most importantly, he became more motivated to learn.<br><br>
										Last summer, he sat his Maths GCSE and achieved a grade 5 far better than what we or the school had expected. We were so relieved and incredibly grateful for Federico’s support.<br><br>
										What I particularly appreciated were the detailed session reports they kept us informed about progress, challenges, and even whether homework was being completed. Federico’s structured approach and dedication made all the difference, and I highly recommend him to any parent looking for a tutor who truly cares about their students' success.</p>

									<h2>Luke S.</h2>
									<p>I’ve always enjoyed Business Studies, but I really struggled with the longer exam questions. I was aiming for a grade 8 or 9, but my school had predicted me a 5 or 6, which was frustrating because I knew I could do better.<br><br>
										Working with Federico completely changed things for me. He broke down key business concepts in a way that was easy to understand and, more importantly, taught me exactly how to approach different types of exam questions. We focused a lot on exam techniques, like how much time to spend on each section, what to prioritise in case studies, and how to structure my answers for maximum marks.<br><br>
										Thanks to his help, I managed to achieve a grade 8 in my GCSE something I wouldn’t have been able to do on my own. I’m really grateful for his support, and I’d definitely recommend him to anyone looking to improve their business grades.</p>
